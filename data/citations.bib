    abstract = "Scarcity of parallel sentence-pairs poses a significant hurdle for training high-quality Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models in bilingually low-resource scenarios. A standard approach is transfer learning, which involves taking a model trained on a high-resource language-pair and fine-tuning it on the data of the low-resource MT condition of interest. However, it is not clear generally which high-resource language-pair offers the best transfer learning for the target MT setting. Furthermore, different transferred models may have complementary semantic and/or syntactic strengths, hence using only one model may be sub-optimal. In this paper, we tackle this problem using knowledge distillation, where we propose to distill the knowledge of ensemble of teacher models to a single student model. As the quality of these teacher models varies, we propose an effective adaptive knowledge distillation approach to dynamically adjust the contribution of the teacher models during the distillation process. Experiments on transferring from a collection of six language pairs from IWSLT to five low-resource language-pairs from TED Talks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to +0.9 BLEU score improvements compared to strong baselines.",

In this paper, we propose a novel training strategy named LSSD (LanguageSpecific Self-Distillation), which can alleviate the convergence inconsistency and help MNMT models achieve the best performance on each language pair simultaneously. Specifically, LSSD picks up language-specific best checkpoints for each language pair to teach the current model on the fly. Furthermore, we systematically explore three sample-level manipulations of knowledge transferring. Experimental results on three datasets show that LSSD obtains consistent improvements towards all language pairs and achieves the state-of-the-art.",

Our results consistently demonstrate substantial improvements not only in low-resource translation quality (up to $+3.6$ BLEU), but also for high-resource translation quality (up to $+0.5$ BLEU).

abstract = {Multilingual NMT has developed rapidly, but still has performance degradation caused by language diversity and model capacity constraints. To achieve the competitive accuracy of multilingual translation despite such limitations, knowledge distillation, which improves the student network by matching the teacher network‚Äôs output, has been applied and shown enhancement by focusing on the important parts of the teacher distribution. However, existing knowledge distillation methods for multilingual NMT rarely consider the knowledge, which has an important function as the student model‚Äôs target, in the process. In this article, we propose two distillation strategies that effectively use the knowledge to improve the accuracy of multilingual NMT. First, we introduce a language-family-based approach, guiding to select appropriate knowledge for each language pair. By distilling the knowledge of multilingual teachers that each processes a group of languages classified by language families, the multilingual model overcomes accuracy degradation caused by linguistic diversity. Second, we propose target-oriented knowledge distillation, which intensively focuses on the ground-truth target of knowledge with a penalty strategy. Our method provides a sensible distillation by penalizing samples without actual targets, while additionally targeting the ground-truth targets. Experiments using TED Talk datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with BLEU scores increment. Discussions of distilled knowledge and further observations of the methods also validate our results.},

However, this performance comes at the cost of significantly bloated models which aren{'}t practically deployable. Knowledge Distillation is one popular technique to develop competitive lightweight models: In this work, we first evaluate its use in compressing MT models, focusing specifically on languages with extremely limited training data. Through our analysis across 8 languages, we find that the variance in the performance of the distilled models due to their dependence on priors including the amount of synthetic data used for distillation, the student architecture, training hyper-parameters and confidence of the teacher models, makes distillation a brittle compression mechanism. To mitigate this, we further explore the use of post-training quantization for the compression of these models. Here, we find that while Distillation provides gains across some low-resource languages, Quantization provides more consistent performance trends for the entire range of languages, especially the lowest-resource languages in our target set.",

abstract="Multilingual knowledge distillation is proposed for multilingual sentence embedding alignment. In this paper, it is found out that multilingual knowledge distillation could implicitly achieve cross-lingual word embedding alignment, which is critically important for reference-free machine translation evaluation (where source texts are directly compared with system translations). Then with the framework of BERTScore, we propose a metric BERTScore-MKD for reference-free machine translation evaluation. From the experimental results on the into-English language pairs of WMT17-19, the reference-free metric BERTScore-MKD is very competitive (not only best mean scores, but also better than BLEU on WMT17-18) when the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics that we know are chosen for comparison. Moreover, the results on WMT19 demonstrate that BERTScore-MKD is also suitable for reference-based machine translation evaluation (where reference texts are used to be compared with system translations).",

abstract="Multilingual neural machine translation employs a single model to translate multiple languages, enabling efficient cross-lingual transferability through shared parameters. However, multilingual training suffers from negative language interference, especially interference with high-resource languages. Existing approaches generally use language-specific modules to distinguish heterogeneous characteristics among different languages but suffer from the parameter explosion problem. In this paper, we propose a ``divide and conquer'' multilingual translation training method based on the importance of neurons that can mitigate negative language interference effectively without adding additional parameters. The key technologies can be summarized as estimation, pruning, distillation, and fine-tuning. Specifically, we estimate the importance of existing pre-trained model neurons, dividing them into the important ones representing general knowledge of each language and the unimportant ones representing individual knowledge of each low-resource language. Then, we prune the pre-trained model, retaining only the important neurons, and train the pruned model supervised by the original complete model via selective distillation to compensate for some performance loss due to unstructured pruning. Finally, we restore the pruned neurons and only fine-tune them. Experimental results on several language pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

This can lead to the hallucination problem, where target tokens are generated without support from the source sentence. The prefix-to-prefix training data used to train SiMT models are not always parallel, due to divergent word order between the source and target languages, and can contribute to the problem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages traditional translation models as teachers and employs a two-stage beam search algorithm to generate monotonic yet accurate reference translations for sequence-level knowledge distillation. Experimental results demonstrate the significant improvements achieved by our approach over multiple strong SiMT baselines, leading to new state-of-the-art performance across various language pairs. Notably, when evaluated on a monotonic version of the WMT15 De-En test set, which includes references generated in a more monotonic style by professional translators, our approach achieves even more substantial improvement over the baselines. The source code and data are publicly available for further exploration.",

The standard paradigm of exploiting them includes two steps: first, pre-training a model, e.g. BERT, with a large scale unlabeled monolingual data. Then, fine-tuning the pre-trained model with labeled data from downstream tasks. However, in neural machine translation (NMT), we address the problem that the training objective of the bilingual task is far different from the monolingual pre-trained model. This gap leads that only using fine-tuning in NMT can not fully utilize prior language knowledge. In this paper, we propose an A&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;pt&lt;/span&gt; framework for acquiring knowledge from pre-trained model to NMT. The proposed approach includes two modules: 1). a dynamic fusion mechanism to fuse task-specific features adapted from general knowledge into NMT network, 2). a knowledge distillation paradigm to learn language knowledge continuously during the NMT training process. The proposed approach could integrate suitable knowledge from pre-trained models to improve the NMT.

However, they only obtain one lightweight student each time. Consequently, we have to conduct KD multiple times when different students are required at the same time, which could be resource-intensive. Additionally, these students are individually optimized, and thus lack interactions with each other, leading to their potential not being fully exerted. In this work, we propose a novel All-In-One Knowledge Distillation(AIO-KD) framework for NMT, which generates multiple satisfactory students at once. Under AIO-KD, we first randomly extract fewer-layer subnetworks from the teacher as the sample students. Then, we jointly optimize the teacher and these students, where the students simultaneously learn the knowledge from the teacher and interact with other students via mutual learning. When utilized, we re-extract the candidate students, satisfying the specifications of various devices. Particularly, we adopt carefully-designed strategies for AIO-KD: 1) we dynamically detach gradients to prevent poorly-performed students from negatively affecting the teacher during the knowledge transfer, which could subsequently impact other students; 2) we design a two-stage mutual learning strategy, which alleviates the negative impacts of poorly-performed students on the early-stage student interactions. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and eco-friendliness of AIO-KD. Our source code is available at https://github.com/DeepLearnXMU/AIO-KD.",

Our results consistently demonstrate substantial improvements not only in low-resource translation quality (up to $+3.6$ BLEU), but also for high-resource translation quality (up to $+0.5$ BLEU). Our experiments show that it is possible to create multilingual datastores that are a quarter of the size, achieving a 5.3x speed improvement, by using linguistic similarities for datastore creation.",

We propose four distilling variants under our framework and show that existing SeqKD and ENGINE approaches are approximations of our FDISTILL methods. We further derive step-wise decomposition for our FDISTILL, reducing intractable sequence-level divergence to word-level losses that can be computed in a tractable manner. Experiments across four datasets show that our methods outperform existing KD approaches, and that our symmetric distilling losses can better force the student to learn from the teacher distribution.",

However, for some languages, bilingual data is not abundant. In this paper, to make better use of both monolingual and limited bilingual data, we propose a new knowledge distillation method called Dual Knowledge Distillation (DKD). For monolingual data, we use a self-distillation strategy which combines self-training and knowledge distillation for the encoder to extract more consistent monolingual representation. For bilingual data, on top of the k Nearest Neighbor Knowledge Distillation (kNN-KD) method, a similar self-distillation strategy is adopted as a consistency regularization method to force the decoder to produce consistent output. Experiments on standard datasets, multi-domain translation datasets, and low-resource datasets show that DKD achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including kNN-KD.}

In this work, we show that self-training improves the flicker-latency tradeoff, while maintaining similar translation quality to the original. Our analysis indicates that self-training reduces flicker by controlling monotonicity. Furthermore, self-training can be combined with biased beam search to further improve the flicker-latency tradeoff.",

Transformer has shown significant performance improvements for many NLP tasks in recent years. However, their large size, expensive computational cost, and long inference time make it challenging to deploy them to resource-constrained devices. Existing Transformer compression methods mainly focus on reducing the size of the encoder ignoring the fact that the decoder takes the major portion of the long inference time. In this paper, we propose PET (Parameter-Efficient knowledge distillation on Transformer), an efficient Transformer compression method that reduces the size of both the encoder and decoder. In PET, we identify and exploit pairs of parameter groups for efficient weight sharing, and employ a warm-up process using a simplified task to increase the gain through Knowledge Distillation. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that PET outperforms existing methods in machine translation tasks. Specifically, on the IWSLT‚Äô14 EN‚ÜíDE task, PET reduces the memory usage by 81.20% and accelerates the inference speed by 45.15% compared to the uncompressed model, with a minor decrease in BLEU score of 0.27.},

However, it may suffer from the forgetting problem and the structural inconsistency between pretrained LMs and NMT models. Knowledge distillation (KD) may be a potential solution to alleviate these issues, but few studies have investigated language knowledge transfer from pretrained language models to NMT models through KD. In this paper, we propose Pretrained Bidirectional Distillation (PBD) for NMT, which aims to efficiently transfer bidirectional language knowledge from masked language pretraining to NMT models. Its advantages are reflected in efficiency and effectiveness through a globally defined and bidirectional context-aware distillation objective. Bidirectional language knowledge of the entire sequence is transferred to an NMT model concurrently during translation training. Specifically, we propose self-distilled masked language pretraining to obtain the PBD objective. We also design PBD losses to efficiently distill the language knowledge, in the form of token probabilities, to the encoder and decoder of an NMT model using the PBD objective. Extensive experiments reveal that pretrained bidirectional distillation can significantly improve machine translation performance and achieve competitive or even better results than previous pretrain-finetune or unified multilingual translation methods in supervised, unsupervised, and zero-shot scenarios. Empirically, it is concluded that pretrained bidirectional distillation is an effective and efficient method for transferring language knowledge from pretrained language models to NMT models.",

    abstract = "Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising technique for model compression in neural machine translation. However, where the knowledge hides in KD is still not clear, which may hinder the development of KD. In this work, we first unravel this mystery from an empirical perspective and show that the knowledge comes from the top-1 predictions of teachers, which also helps us build a potential connection between word- and sequence-level KD. Further, we point out two inherent issues in vanilla word-level KD based on this finding. Firstly, the current objective of KD spreads its focus to whole distributions to learn the knowledge, yet lacks special treatment on the most crucial top-1 information. Secondly, the knowledge is largely covered by the golden information due to the fact that most top-1 predictions of teachers overlap with ground-truth tokens, which further restricts the potential of KD. To address these issues, we propose a new method named Top-1 Information Enhanced Knowledge Distillation (TIE-KD). Specifically, we design a hierarchical ranking loss to enforce the learning of the top-1 information from the teacher. Additionally, we develop an iterative KD procedure to infuse more additional knowledge by distilling on the data without ground-truth targets. Experiments on WMT{'}14 English-German, WMT{'}14 English-French and WMT{'}16 English-Romanian demonstrate that our method can respectively boost Transformer$_{base}$ students by +1.04, +0.60 and +1.11 BLEU scores and significantly outperforms the vanilla word-level KD baseline. Besides, our method shows higher generalizability on different teacher-student capacity gaps than existing KD techniques.",

    abstract = "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) remains a formidable challenge, especially when dealing with low-resource languages. Pre-trained sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) multi-lingual models, such as mBART-50, have demonstrated impressive performance in various low-resource NMT tasks. However, their pre-training has been confined to 50 languages, leaving out support for numerous low-resource languages, particularly those spoken in the Indian subcontinent. Expanding mBART-50{'}s language support requires complex pre-training, risking performance decline due to catastrophic forgetting. Considering these expanding challenges, this paper explores a framework that leverages the benefits of a pre-trained language model along with knowledge distillation in a seq2seq architecture to facilitate translation for low-resource languages, including those not covered by mBART-50. The proposed framework employs a multilingual encoder-based seq2seq model as the foundational architecture and subsequently uses complementary knowledge distillation techniques to mitigate the impact of imbalanced training. Our framework is evaluated on three low-resource Indic languages in four Indic-to-Indic directions, yielding significant BLEU-4 and chrF improvements over baselines. Further, we conduct human evaluation to confirm effectiveness of our approach. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/raypretam/Two-step-low-res-NMT.",

    abstract = "Knowledge distillation (KD) is a common approach to compress a teacher model to reduce its inference cost and memory footprint, by training a smaller student model. However, in the context of autoregressive language models (LMs), we empirically find that larger teacher LMs might dramatically result in a poorer student. In response to this problem, we conduct a series of analyses and reveal that different tokens have different teaching modes, neglecting which will lead to performance degradation. Motivated by this, we propose a simple yet effective adaptive teaching approach (ATKD) to improve the KD. The core of ATKD is to reduce rote learning and make teaching more diverse and flexible. Extensive experiments on 8 LM tasks show that, with the help of ATKD, various baseline KD methods can achieve consistent and significant performance gains (up to +3.04{\%} average score) across all model types and sizes. More encouragingly, ATKD can improve the student model generalization effectively.",

  abstract = 	 {Sequential prediction problems such as imitation learning, where future observations depend on previous predictions (actions), violate the common i.i.d. assumptions made in statistical learning. This leads to poor performance in theory and often in practice. Some recent approaches provide stronger guarantees in this setting, but remain somewhat unsatisfactory as they train either non-stationary or stochastic policies and require a large number of iterations. In this paper, we propose a new iterative algorithm, which trains a stationary deterministic policy, that can be seen as a no regret algorithm in an online learning setting. We show that any such no regret algorithm, combined with additional reduction assumptions, must find a policy with good performance under the distribution of observations it induces in such sequential settings. We demonstrate that this new approach outperforms previous approaches on two challenging imitation learning problems and a benchmark sequence labeling problem.}
