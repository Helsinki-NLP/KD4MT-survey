# KD4MT: A Survey of Knowledge Distillation for Machine Translation

This is the list of the papers surveyed in the manuscript " KD4MT: A Survey of Knowledge Distillation for Machine Translation."

In this repository, we provide the full list of surveyed papers as well as the database that we have compiled for our analysis.

## Abstract

Large-scale Machine Translation (MT) systems pose a challenge in terms of their environmental impact and accessibility. 
One method to produce more efficient machine translation models is Knowledge Distillation (KD). 
This survey comprehensively explores the application of KD in the domain of MT. 
We propose a double taxonomy that classifies the surveyed articles in regards to their method used and their application.
